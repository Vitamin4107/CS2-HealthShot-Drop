  ```

This project has been fully configured to use CMake as its build system. All build settings, including dependency paths and compiler/linker options, are defined in the CMakeLists.txt file.

3. **Build**

Open a Command Prompt: For best results, use the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```
Build the Project:

```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```
This command builds the project in the Release configuration. The output DLL will be located inside the generated build output directory (for example, in build/bin).
